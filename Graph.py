# When tackling complex problems, itâ€™s a massive advantage if you can model the problem as a graph.
#Can be initialized as a directed graph, where edges are set in one direction.
#Stores every vertex inside a dictionary
#Vertex data is the key and the vertex instance is the value.
#Has methods to add vertices, edges between vertices, and determine if a path exists between two vertices.
